# Header Referencer for Obsidian

A simple header indexer for Obsidian.

Aside from the super category edition, the rest should be usable and configurable to some extent, if not then feel free to open an issue. The plugin is personal at the moment and isn't supposed to be used for other people, with that in mind don't expect for me to fix each and every issue.
